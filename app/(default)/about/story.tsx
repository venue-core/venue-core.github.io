            <p className="text-lg text-gray-600 mb-8">
              Founded in early 2023, OneVenue emerged from Kat's firsthand
              experience navigating the complexities of wedding planning during
              her engagement. Recognizing the significant effort, coordination,
              and overhead her vendors took on to craft unforgettable memories,
              Kat sought a solution.

              Kat joined forces with Stan, a seasoned engineer from Berkeley.
              With 20 years of experience building software solutions, they
              decided to create OneVenue: the digital assistant for venue
              managers and vendors. OneVenue simplifies tasks like scheduling,
              price estimation, payment collection, and cash flow management.
